        <p> SOCCER TEAM </p>
      </div>
      <P class="teaminfo"> <img src="images/team1.jpg" width="208" height="145" alt="soccerteam"  align="right"/> A football team is the collective name given to a group of players selected together in the various team sports known  as football.Such 
        teams could be selected to play  in a match against an opposingteam, to represent   a football club,  group, state or  nation, an All-star 
        team  or  even  selected as a hypothetical  team (such  as  a  Dream  Team  or  Team of the Century)  and  never  play  an  actual  match.
        There are several varieties of football, notably Association  football, Gridiron football, Australian
        rules football, Gaelic football, rugby league, and  rugby  union. The   number of players  selected 
        for each  team within these varieties and their  associated  codes  can vary  substantially. In some,
        use of the word "team" is sometimes limited to  those who play  on the  field in a match and does
        not  always include   other players   who  may  take  part  as replacements   or emergency players. 
        "Football squad" may be  used to  be  inclusiv e of  these  support and r eserve  players. The  term  
        football   club   is  the   most  commonly   used   for   a   sports   club   which   is   an   organised   or 
        incorporated body  with a president,  committee and a   set of rules responsible  for ensuring the 
        continued playing  existence  of one  or more teams  which are selected for  regular competition 
        play (and which may participate in several different divisions or leagues).The oldest football clubs date back to the early 19th century. 
        The words team and club are sometimes used interchangeably by supporters, although they typically refer to the team within the club
        playing in the highest division or competition. </P>

        </p>
        <p class="p2">
         The players of any team are the people who are seen by the public. It is the  accumulation of 
            everyone's  efforts within the  setup  and, without the  contributions of them, there would be 
            nothing to see and ultimately no team.

          Goalkeeper
        </p>
        <p class="p2">
          A goalkeeper in any team is the person  that  makes  saves. On  Wikipedia,  the goalkeepers are the 
            users  that  go through  article  for  deletion  discussions,  looking  for articles to save from deletion. 
            Although they cannot save  everything,  they are  able  to  keep  content on  the  encyclopedia that, 
            without their efforts, would be deleted.

         Defenders
        </p>
        <p class="p2">
          The  defenders  of the project  work slowly  to  create  the best  articles  that Wikipedia has to offer. 
            They create many featured articles and good  articles but have to spend time researching topics, so 
            ultimately they work on a relatively small  number of pages – but the value  that they add to them is 
            incredible.

         Midfielders
        </p>
        <p class="p2">
          The  midfielders of any team are the people that  hold the  whole  team together .  Their  work  may 
            help  bridge  the  gap  between  the  stubs  and  featured  articles  or  may be gnomish tasks, such as 
            copy editing or wikifying. Without their  efforts,  Wikipedia  would  be  a  much less reliable source.

          Attackers
        </p>
        <p class="p2">
           The attackers  of  Wikipedia  are  the  users  that  create  many  articles .  They  may  not be  the best 
            articles  Wikipedia has to offer,  but   their  contributions  mean  that  Wikipedia covers most topics 
            that the reader would wish to read about. Examples of their work include creating stub articles

          Backroom staff
        </p>
        <p class="p2">
           As  with all  successful  teams,  the  backroom  staff  hold the  team  together  and  offer  advice  and 
            encouragement to help the team play to the best of  their ability. Backroom staff don't get credited 
            by the fans, but, without their efforts, the team would not be as successful as they are.

          Directors
        </p>
        <p class="p2">
           The directors of Wikipedia are the people  that  have to  make the tough  decisions  right at the top 
            level. They include the  arbitration  committee  and  Jimbo Wales. They  often  have to  make tough 
            decisions  which the  players and other staff don't like – but they have the long term interests of the 
            project at heart.

          Managers
        </p>
        <p class="p2">
         Managers co-ordinate the day to day running of the team.These users contribute to noticeboards
            such as  Wikipedia:Administrators'  noticeboard,  Wikipedia : Administrator  intervention  against 
            vandalism, Wikipedia:Requests for page protection and CAT:CSD. The managers also  participate 
            in policy discussions in an attempt to increase the efficiency of the team.

          Coaching staff
        </p>
        <p class="p2">
          These users analyse the work of the players in an  attempt to make  the final product  better. They 
            contribute to XfD discussions and other process related discussions to help improve what the fans
            see.

          First aid staff
        </p>
        <p class="p2">
          If someone has an injury or is feeling down in the community, the first  aid staff  are  the users that 
            help these users overcome their problems. In many ways, they keep the morale up.

        </p>
        <p class="p2">
          These users protect what is  coming into  the project. They include  the  new page patrollers. They 
            act  as  a  gate  to  keep  Wikipedia's  content  reliable . Without  these  users, many  pages  would 
            appear on the project that should not be there.

          Fans
        </p>
        <p class="p2">
           As with any team, the fans are the users that come  to  watch the team play – they are our readers. 
            Without their fans, the role of any player or backroom  staff  would be  pointless. The fans are the 
            most important part of any team. It is important that standards do not drop, or the fans will begin 
            to leave – without that, we have no project.

          Hooligans
        </p>
        <p class="p2">
          Hooligans  in any  environment  cause disruption. These users are not wanted on the project. They 
            vandalise  the project  through  IP's or throwaway accounts. Generally speaking, the gate staff and 
            matchday stewards keep these users at bay.

          League
        </p>
        <p class="p2">
          The English wikipedia is in a domestic league with its same language  counterparts. These include 
            Wiktionary, Simple English Wikipedia and  Wikinews. On the world stage, the  English Wikipedia 
            is on the same level  as  all the  other  language  Wikipedias. Its  main  rivals  include  the German, 
            French and Spanish  Wikipedias. All  the teams  have one  goal – to be the best that  they possibly 
            can be with the resources they have available．
